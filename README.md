# Volunteero front-end base

## Deployed at https://volunteero-front-end-base.herokuapp.com/

Project is  automatically redeployed when you push to master

## How I do work with it? I guess you should do the same.

1. First install angular cli globally https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

2. Then pull and do an <b>npm install</b>. There is again the angualar cli as a local dependency, but just bare with it being there, its used for deployment purposes, anyway we use the global angular cli all the time. The server.js is also not engaged in any way, its just there to work when we deploy.

3. How to run the project -> cd to project directory -> run <b>ng serve</b> (don't mind the ng setup in the package.json its just there, so we run it with global angular cli).
    * Also `npm run dev` run in project root will serve the dev version and open the browser with the project.  

4. A tip: these angular cli features are very usefull https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate
In out project when we generate we do it like that, example: <b>ng generate component components/tab-bar</b> and so on if you wanna nest more. Same when you generate service: <b>ng generate service services/jesus</b>

  

6. Be ready to go.

7. And now go.
